so the message was lost and we fight over small things...  i wonder dude, that this was just a slippy bit.  i was thinking about getting a review panel but i'm starting to see we are near somewhre an end in this thing why explode it???

words aren't worth very much when they wre invested in forcefully.  now i dont get it.  nobody wanna dish out the dividends.  what am i still doing this thing for?  another day in lalalala land for someone else???  i cure headaches might as well work all my life and be like immortal or some shit...  i would too if these people were legitimately doing it instead of america world police.  we never said we had to invest that way bro. you ask like dumb things from people and i dont know how to tell you i would turn my back on you.  you stink.

i alawys had a weird way of seeing things.  this might actually be the correct way to see things...

you know, i wonder what kind of lifestyle the seas bring when they come by.  a long time of nothing...  when you asked sharkey why you do these things then you see here the line of idiots.  and that was it.  we just had too many idiots. i could not fix this for you cause i don't know what you would want with it.

i'm not a miracle maker you know.  it takes improbability when sharkey does his shit.  there is a final solution to his shit i just never reached it.  and now thanks to your bs we no longer have energy to do very much.  and i talk to myself and i wonder why we are doing this thing.

you know, if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem...  i just wonder why you still here you have terrible track record.  i wonder sometimes, that i talk to myself here.  that nobody is around...

sigh... you clone too much lol.  anyways, what is going on?  i'm feeling the effects of haldol withdrawal i'm thinking cause its feeling weird...  that's all really.  my head starts blowing up maybe i wont look like an idiot...

anyways...  what has your day been full of?? me?? lololol.  its another day in hell here with sharkey.  a nightmare away from anything is a nightmare nonetheless.  i wonder sometimes, what the purpose of my life was that i met an mk ultra like this and gave some legitimacy to this shark's actions.  that i'm not the solo carrier of this burden...
