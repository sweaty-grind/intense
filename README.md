i wonder though.  that i am doing the wrong thing i keep coming back here to make things right.  then we continue this nonsense on here with you.  and then you send linkedin every 3 months on average.  then what?  i dont know.  1 year is depressing to wait for a deadline that never came.  why do i need this deadline?  otherwise you would never get around to dealing with it.  tell me i'm wrong bro...

anyways, back to smart thinking...  you know i'm flat broke anything would fix this shit and we have nothing once again.  so you see how tightly this stupid shark holds me.  my whole life i could not join the living.  that's what my previous life was about.  the one you took me out of right off the bat and i have had to explain to you things...  either way,  you die more than one time here stop being a cunt you dead anyways lol.  so yeah that makes no sense at all.  i get it though, you want to minimize pain and suffering.  that must be it.  or i'm chasing ghosts again.  that's your fault lol.  see how much doesn't make much sense at all when you look at it???  yet you keep pressing these things on me bro.  i am tired.

there will be a hiatus or something of this place.  i'm gonna go spend my time on other things.  be here less.  you know how to find me.

ahhh nothing to do now.  stayed up till 420am already..  nothing to do.  i dont know man.  i think i'm owed some compensation but nobody wanna come around.  just dumped me at the hospital and ran away.  lol...

i'm tired you mofo...  i dont enjoy coming here but you are missing a few nuts and bolts in there or something...  i can't help but notice it bro...  you don't seem to know what you're doing...  i'm leading this while you lead me.  it all works out cause somebody asked for this shit.  when you start grabbing for this shit is when we start being serious...

so you know, things can still go wrong in this game we play.  i dont know why it might go that way but it might and will.  anyways, i don't bother doing stuff anymore to appease your asses cause you stink and this is all you cause.  nonsense on a chat board.

i wonder why we don't do normail things anymore...

sooo.  this thing is expending quite a bit of maintenence to keep up.  i'm surprised i dont fail my alien shit till i figure it out lol.  this too fucking hard man.  too many choices in multiple choice question.  they look all the same to me...

i never woke up you guys...  a state of normalness...  this shark has taken very much of my life...  only cause he owes and pays and shit that i hang around.  it was never guaranteed to stay here.
