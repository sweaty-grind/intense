# intense

intended...

i wonder though.  that i am doing the wrong thing i keep coming back here to make things right.  then we continue this nonsense on here with you.  and then you send linkedin every 3 months on average.  then what?  i dont know.  1 year is depressing to wait for a deadline that never came.  why do i need this deadline?  otherwise you would never get around to dealing with it.  tell me i'm wrong bro...

anyways, back to smart thinking...  you know i'm flat broke anything would fix this shit and we have nothing once again.  so you see how tightly this stupid shark holds me.  my whole life i could not join the living.  that's what my previous life was about.  the one you took me out of right off the bat and i have had to explain to you things...  either way,  you die more than one time here stop being a cunt you dead anyways lol.  so yeah that makes no sense at all.  i get it though, you want to minimize pain and suffering.  that must be it.  or i'm chasing ghosts again.  that's your fault lol.  see how much doesn't make much sense at all when you look at it???  yet you keep pressing these things on me bro.  i am tired.

there will be a hiatus or something of this place.  i'm gonna go spend my time on other things.  be here less.  you know how to find me.
