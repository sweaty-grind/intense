you know... i think i burped out a big one and life ran away again.  another dream in reality.  i wonder the price of these things i do to you i wonder you would do to me.  so we do things to each other.  am i correct?  so i did a weird one to you.  you did a weird one first remember that.  anyways,i wonder why you sit here pretending you dont know what you're doing.  one profile view in private mode sucks dude.

i'm trying to understand why i do this and its a release and let go system.  i produce nothing of quality just quantity.  and sometimes i wonder why these tangents were random and yet you press them on me.  i dont get it.

maybe you were trying to see value where there was none.  that i am stuck like this still you idiot.  i dont know how long this is gonna take.  it'll be a while all i know.  from precedent lol...

seriously though, i dont know man.  its another day we did this.  for people caught in a review panel you sure respond a little strangely.  excessive i must admit.  of doing nothing of course...  i dont know man, we just feeling tired its been 5 years bro.  another week we are clean of your works.  i forgot to tell you altruistic work has its benefitis its not maintained by lousy shit.  so i doubt you have any more shit for me to do.  so i'll take it as a point of reference saved here.  that we finished this aspect of something i dont remember anymore is now complete...
