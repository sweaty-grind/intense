# intense

intended...

so the message was lost and we fight over small things...  i wonder dude, that this was just a slippy bit.  i was thinking about getting a review panel but i'm starting to see we are near somewhre an end in this thing why explode it???

words aren't worth very much when they wre invested in forcefully.  now i dont get it.  nobody wanna dish out the dividends.  what am i still doing this thing for?  another day in lalalala land for someone else???  i cure headaches might as well work all my life and be like immortal or some shit...  i would too if these people were legitimately doing it instead of america world police.  we never said we had to invest that way bro. you ask like dumb things from people and i dont know how to tell you i would turn my back on you.  you stink.
